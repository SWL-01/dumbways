# üéÆ PathQuest - 2.5D Isometric MBTI Personality Game

## ‚ú® What's Been Created

I've built a complete **Duolingo-style RPG game** with Phaser.js for your MBTI personality quiz!

### üéØ Features Implemented

#### 1. **2.5D Isometric Game Engine**
- ‚úÖ Built with Phaser.js physics engine
- ‚úÖ Pseudo-isometric depth sorting (objects closer to bottom appear in front)
- ‚úÖ Pixel-perfect rendering (`pixelArt: true`)
- ‚úÖ Smooth animations and movement

#### 2. **Interactive Gameplay**
- üñ±Ô∏è **Click-to-Move**: Click anywhere to walk there
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Interaction**: Press `E` or `SPACE` to interact
- üéØ **Target Marker**: Green circle shows where you're walking
- ‚ú® **Object Highlighting**: Objects glow yellow when you're near
- üì¢ **Interaction Prompts**: "Press E to interact with..." text appears

#### 3. **12 Unique Scenes**
Each MBTI scenario has its own themed environment:

| Scenario | Scene | Interactive Objects |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Party | Living room with party vibe | Snack Table, Couch, Music System |
| Planning | Office meeting room | Conference Table, Whiteboard |

#### 4. **Game Mechanics**
- **Player Character**: Blue sprite that you control
- **NPC Characters**: Orange sprite for each scene
- **Interactive Objects**: Green sprites (2-3 per scene)
- **Collision Detection**: Walk close to trigger interactions
- **Smooth Movement**: Physics-based pathfinding
- **Progress Tracking**: Question counter and progress bar

#### 5. **Visual Design**
- Isometric grid overlay for depth perception
- Color-coded sprites (Blue=Player, Orange=NPC, Green=Objects)
- Pixel art rendering mode
- Gradient backgrounds as fallbacks
- Object labels that appear on approach
- Depth-based layering

## üöÄ How to Play

## ‚ú® Key Improvements Over Previous Version

| Old System | New Isometric System |
|------------|---------------------|
| CSS-based movement | Phaser physics engine |
| Single background | 12 unique themed scenes |
| 1 NPC per scene | NPCs + 2-3 interactive objects |
| Simple click detection | Proximity-based collision |
| No depth sorting | Isometric depth layering |
| Static sprites | Scalable, animated system |

## üîß Customization Options

### Change NPC Position
Edit line in `IsometricGameScreen.tsx`:
```tsx
party: {
  npcPosition: { x: 600, y: 300 }, // Change X, Y here
  ...
}
```

### Add More Objects
```tsx
objects: [
  { x: 400, y: 350, type: 'table', name: 'Snack Table' },
  // Add more here
],
```

### Adjust Interaction Distance
Line 338:
```tsx
let minDistance = 80; // Make smaller for closer interaction
```

### Change Movement Speed
Line 324:
```tsx
const speed = 180; // Increase for faster movement
```

## üéÆ Future Enhancements

Want to make it even better? Consider:

1. **Animated Sprites**
   - Add walking animations (left, right, up, down)
   - Idle animations
   - Interaction animations

2. **Sound Effects**
   - Footstep sounds
   - Interaction sounds
   - Background music per scene

3. **Visual Effects**
   - Particle effects on interaction
   - Screen transitions between scenes
   - Character shadows

4. **More Interactions**
   - Multiple NPCs per scene
   - Branching conversations
   - Mini-games

## üìä Technical Details

- **Engine**: Phaser 3 (installed via npm)
- **Physics**: Arcade Physics for 2D collision
- **Rendering**: WebGL with pixel art mode
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript
- **State Management**: React hooks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Black screen with green border?**
- Background images not loaded (fallback colors are shown)
- Add your scene images to `/public/scenes/`
- Or ignore it - the game works with colored backgrounds!

**Character not moving?**
- Try clicking different areas
- Check browser console for errors

**Interaction not working?**
- Walk closer to the NPC/object
- Wait for the yellow highlight
- Press E or SPACE key

## üéâ You're Done!

Your game is **ready to play right now**! Run `npm run dev` and enjoy your Duolingo-style MBTI personality game!

Add custom pixel art scene images anytime to make it look even better. üöÄ
